      <h1>About <i>The Abstract Machine</i></h1>
      <p>By some appearances, computer science is an , aggressively fast-moving field, clanging machinery, bit-flipping, (sound of) whirling CPU fans and (flicker of) terminals lit up in radioactive green.</p>
      <p>bullet lists of must-knows and how-tos and dont-dos and tech news.</p>
      <p>But brush away the dusty exhaust left over by the latest tech stack to crumble, and you will see a faint glimmer. The bedrock of concepts ... Enduring, profound, ... lattice of ideas. Computer science at its prettiest.</p>
      <p>This is an website for computer science romantics, dedicated to the exhibition and explanation of concepts that either make you fall in love with computing, or remind you of why you once did.</p>
