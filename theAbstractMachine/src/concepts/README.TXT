For each concept, let there be: compressed PNG (or webP files) or SVG, each with its own initial position. Store relative paths.

Also, a JSON file that splits the learning trajectory into steps. For each step:

* key is folder-name and should be enough to retrieve all materials.

* GRAPHQL should be able to retrieve all relevant materials based on folder contents

* which graphics will be visible and at what opacity?
(full opacity ones will have a glow)

* list of textboxes which will become paragraphs, shown successively.

* for laptop screens, somehow enable widgets to be embedded.

At the bottom of each animation, there will be a slider.

Elsewhere, a master JSON shows the relationships among all concepts.
